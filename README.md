Traffic Volume Prediction Using Time Series  Forecasting Machine Learning Models and Analysis 



This project focuses on researching Support Vector Regression SVR model for intelligent 
transportation systems using a wavetronix sensor sensor information that gives timestamped traffic volume data. 

The data loaded has already been pre-processed using exponential smoothing earlier.
